/// Finds two indices in the list [nums] whose elements sum up to [target].
///
/// This function works with generic type [T] where `==` and subtraction are supported.
/// However, Dart currently does not support operator constraints on generics,
/// so this implementation assumes [T] is `int` or a similar numeric type.
///
/// Returns a list containing the two indices if such a pair exists, otherwise returns null.

/// ```dart
/// var result = twoSum<int>([2, 7, 11, 15], 9);
/// print(result); // Outputs: [0, 1]
/// ```
